# ServUO-RconPacketHandlers
Provides basic RCON functionality for ServUO servers.

Installation
-----
Grab the Custom folder from this repo and drop it in your server's Scripts folder.

The result should look like this:

ServUO
- Scripts
- - Custom
- - - RconConfig.cfg
- - - RconPacketHandlers.cs

Check out the RconConfig.cfg file and change any settings in there that you need. The main thing you'll want to set are your RconPassword and your ListenPort. Once you've changed everything there to what you want, you can just run your server like normal.
