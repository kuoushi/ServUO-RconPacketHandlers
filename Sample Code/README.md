The sample bot in this file was made using Python 3.8. I offer no guarantees that it will work out of the box, but it should work so long as you put in all of the appropriate information in your config files (both for the Python bot, and for the ServUO server side ones).

You will need to install Python 3.8 (it may work on later versions), and then install the following libraries before running the main bot.

pip install discord.py

pip install aioudp

To run the bot, simply open a command prompt, navigate to the folder where all of the files are, and type the following:

python uo-discord-bot-sample.py

(Or, you can potentially just double click the script if you set your python installation up to do that.)

If the bot's running, congratulations, everything should be kind of working now. I can't guarantee it doesn't have bugs, but it should do the basic tasks. Not sure if I'll update this sample code, but it should be a very good place for you to start if you want to work on your own bot code.
